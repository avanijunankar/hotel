                    <p>The hotel is very close to the Mosque and Street within a five-minute walk. It’s safe, no doubt, and the service is very good. Wherever you go, the hotel staff actively greet the breakfast. Although there are not many varieties, the quality of bread and cakes are from Pierre Hermé. The only highlight of the room is the bathroom but hygiene I'm a little disappointed in the situation.</p>
